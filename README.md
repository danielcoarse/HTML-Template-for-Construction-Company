# HTML Template for Construction Company
 Hi there!

 This is a minimal static html themplate for building company. I was starting build this project for real company, that specialize on construction of cottages houses. But work with customer stopped for certain reasons. Although project was finised.

 I won't use this project in future and i don't want it to go to waste.

 So, it has some flaws of course. But don't shy to config something inside.

### Step 1
First thing first, fork the repo to your github account. 

### Step 2
Now, you'll want to clone or download the repo to your local machine. To get the repo link, click on the green 'Clone or download' button on your fork.

Download is pretty self-explanatory. 

To clone the repo, navigate to the folder you'd like to clone the repo on your local machine and type/copy the following command into your terminal or cli: 

```html
git clone REPO_URL
```


## You're All Set!
